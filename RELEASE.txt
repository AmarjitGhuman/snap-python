Snap.py is a Python interface for SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Platform).
SNAP is a general purpose, high performance system for analysis and
manipulation of large networks. SNAP is written in C++ and optimized
for maximum performance and compact graph representation. It easily scales
to massive networks with hundreds of millions of nodes, and billions of edges.
Snap.py provides performance benefits of SNAP, combined with flexibility
of Python. Most of the SNAP functionality is available via Snap.py in Python.
